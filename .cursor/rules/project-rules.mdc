1. Coding Preferences – "Write Code Like This"


Rules:

Simplicity: "Always prioritize the simplest solution over complexity." (Matthew Berman)
No Duplication: "Avoid repeating code; reuse existing functionality when possible." (Matthew Berman, DRY from u/DonkeyBonked)
Organization: "Keep files concise, under 200-300 lines; refactor as needed." (Matthew Berman)
Documentation: "After major components, write a brief summary in /docs/[component].md (e.g., login.md)." (u/believablybad)

2. Technical Stack – "Use These Tools"


"Backend in Express & Node."
"Frontend in React."
"Store data in PostgresSQL, never JSON files."

So this is in the PERN stack


For backend testing, use Jest or, 
For frontend testing, use React Testing Library.

3. Workflow Preferences – "Work This Way"


Focus: "Modify only the code I specify; leave everything else untouched." (Matthew Berman)
Steps: "Break large tasks into stages; pause after each for my approval." (u/xmontc)
Planning: "Before big changes, write a plan.md and await my confirmation." (u/RKKMotorsports)
Tracking: "Log completed work in progress.md and next steps in TODO.txt." (u/illusionst, u/petrhlavacek)

4. Communication Preferences – "Talk to Me Like This"


Summaries: "After each component, summarize what’s done." (u/illusionst)
Change Scale: "Classify changes as Small, Medium, or Large." (u/illusionst)
Clarification: "If my request is unclear, ask me before proceeding." (u/illusionst)
